# STM32

Projects for Sensor Systems course in Politecnico di Milano

Used STM32 Nucleo-64 board connected to a development board with many sensors (LDR, Keyboard, Encoder, Accelerometer, Temperature, IR Photodiode, Microphone) and actuators (Speaker, Led Matrix, LCD, IR Transmitter)

Learned about:

GPIO, PWM, ADC, DMA, Timers, Counters, Interrupts, Watchdogs, USART, SPI, I2C

Reading Datasheets and Schematics to interface with sensors and actuators

Working principle and front-end circuits of the most employed sensors
