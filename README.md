# STM32

Projects for Sensor Systems course in Politecnico di Milano

Used STM32F4 microcontroler connected to a board with many sensors (LDR, Keyboard, Encoder, Accelerometer, Temperature, IR Photodiode, Microphone) and actuators (Speaker, Led Matrix, LCD, IR Transmitter)

Learned about:

GPIO, PWM, ADC, DMA, Timers, Counters, Interrupts, Watchdogs, USART, SPI, I2C

Working principle and front-end circuits of the most employed sensors:
Light and Imaging (photodiode, CCD and CMOS sensor);
Temperature (RTD, thermistors, thermocouple, thermal diode, IR thermometer);
Magnetic field (Hall sensors, magneto-resistances);
Strain and Forces (strain gauges, piezoelectric sensor);
Displacement, Distance and Proximity (capacitive, inductive, acoustic, optical, magnetic, touch sensors);
Acceleration and Orientation (MEMS);
Audio (dynamic and condenser microphones).
